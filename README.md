How to Run this:
1. Make sure Django and everything from requirments.txt is installed!
2. Clone this Repository.
3. Navigate to the "poodle_classroom" folder (the one with manage.py in it)
4. Type "python manage.py runserver"
6. Then, it takes you to a website (http://127.0.0.1:8000/)

P.S All of my CRUD functions and the database connection is in "db_connection.py"
